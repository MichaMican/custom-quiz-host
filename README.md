## Quickstart (Docker Compose)

The easiest way to get started is with Docker Compose using the pre-built image from the GitHub Container Registry:

1. **Download the `docker-compose.yml`** from this repository (or create it with the content below):

   ```yaml
   services:
     custom-quiz-host:
       image: ghcr.io/michamican/custom-quiz-host:latest
       ports:
         - "8080:8080"
       volumes:
         - uploads:/app/uploads
         - highscores:/app/highscores
       restart: unless-stopped

   volumes:
     uploads:
     highscores:
   ```

2. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Display View: `http://localhost:8080/`
   - Remote Control: `http://localhost:8080/remote`
   - Buzzer: `http://localhost:8080/buzzer`

Uploaded media files (images, audio) are persisted in the `uploads` Docker volume and survive container restarts. Highscores are stored separately in the `highscores` volume for independent persistence.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET SDK 10.0** or later
- **Node.js 20.x** or later
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MichaMican/custom-quiz-host.git
   cd custom-quiz-host
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd customquizhost.client
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Run the application**
    
    Option A: Using .NET CLI (runs both frontend and backend through the ASP.NET Core SPA proxy)
    ```bash
    cd CustomQuizHost.Server
    dotnet run
    ```
    This starts the ASP.NET Core backend and launches the Vite development server automatically.

4. **Access the application**
    - Display View: `https://localhost:5173/` or `https://localhost:5173/display`
    - Remote Control: `https://localhost:5173/remote`
    - Buzzer: `https://localhost:5173/buzzer`
    - Backend API and SignalR hub (proxied by Vite): `https://localhost:7135/` or `http://localhost:5200/`

### Docker Deployment

1. **Build the Docker image**
   ```bash
   docker build -f CustomQuizHost.Server/Dockerfile -t custom-quiz-host .
   ```

2. **Run the container**
   
   Option A: Without a volume mount (uploads are not persisted)
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 custom-quiz-host
   ```

   Option B: With a volume mount (uploads and highscores are persisted)
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 -v custom-quiz-host-uploads:/app/uploads -v custom-quiz-host-highscores:/app/highscores custom-quiz-host
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## Usage

### Setting Up a Game

1. **Open the Remote Control** (`/remote`)
2. **Setup Tab**:
   - Add players with their names
   - Create categories
   - Add questions to each category with:
      - Question text
      - Answer
      - Point value (200-1000)
      - Question type (Standard, Image, Image Mozaik, Audio, Video)
      - Optional media file upload

### Hosting a Game

1. **Open the Display View** (`/display`) on a screen visible to all players
2. **Open the Remote Control** (`/remote`) on the host's device
3. **Open Buzzer View** (`/buzzer`) on each player's device
   - Players select their name from the dropdown

### Playing the Game

1. **Host** selects a question from the Display View using Remote Control
2. **Host** clicks "Reveal Question" to show the question
3. **Players** click their buzzer when they know the answer
4. **Host** can see buzz order and award points for correct answers or deduct for incorrect answers
5. Game continues until all questions are answered

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Remote Control)

- Enter: Add players/categories or confirm score edits
- Escape: Cancel score edits
